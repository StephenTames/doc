Is a Dedicated Database Server Required?
========================================

We currently (July 2016) stand up our own Postgres 9.5 database to use as a backing store for Rebar and goiardi (the built-in Chef server we use).  There is nothing preventing us from using other servers (if one is avalible for this sort of thing) but a bit of config work.
